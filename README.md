How it should look when loaded:

When loaded, input your webhook link and then your desired webhook name.

If you have selected nothing as your webhooks username, then it will provide the default username.

The same thing happens in the next input, which is the webhooks message. ^

From here, all you need to do is select the amount of threads you would like to run on.

and Boom! you will see the messages going through to the webhook. :)
